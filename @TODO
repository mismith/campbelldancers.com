- Is it possible to switch the calendar to a slightly more visibly easy to read format? On mobile it is just a bunch of times. Colour block formatting or something?
- add call to action / blurb to registration section
- add blurb explaining locations
- tweak about copy to be more smooth-flowing and impressive
- get photo from Kendra and put up on website as a junior instructor
- And add a photos section, maybe? Or better yet an jnstagram feed with images
- Also, can we make the contact thing a submittable form too? And Tell me your thoughts on register. We actually only need that once they've contacted us and we know they are interested. Maybe hidden till you have a link or something? Separate page? Because it will need a lot more info and that might clutter the site up and not look as good.
